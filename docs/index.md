# Using MLRun 


MLRun is an open MLOps platform for quickly building and managing continuous ML applications across their lifecycle. MLRun integrates into your development and CI/CD environment and automates the delivery of production data, ML pipelines, and online applications. MLRun significantly reduces engineering efforts, time to production, and computation resources.
With MLRun, you can choose any IDE on your local machine or on the cloud. MLRun breaks the silos between data, ML, software, and DevOps/MLOps teams, enabling collaboration and fast continuous improvements.
