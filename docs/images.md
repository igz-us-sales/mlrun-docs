# Images and their usage in MLRun

Every release of MLRun includes several images for different usages.
All images are published to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mlrun) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/mlrun).

## MLRun building images

* `mlrun/mlrun`: The most basic (and smallest) image, can be used for simple jobs. Basically just MLRun installed on 
  top of a python image.
* `mlrun/ml-base`: Image for file acquisition, compression, dask jobs, simple training jobs and other utilities. Like
`mlrun/mlrun` with the addition of [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and other [python 
  packages](./base/requirements.txt).
* `mlrun/ml-models`: Image for analyzing data, model training and deep learning on CPUs. Built on top of 
  `mlrun/ml-base` with the addition of [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), 
  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Horovod](https://horovod.ai/) and other [python packages](
  ./models/requirements.txt).
* `mlrun/ml-models-gpu`: Same as `mlrun/ml-models` but for GPUs.

The files are located in [MLRun Dockerfiles](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun/tree/development/dockerfiles).

## MLRun images and external docker images

There is no difference in the usage between the MLRun images and external docker images. However, MLRun images:
- Resolve auto tags: If you specify ```image="mlrun/mlrun"``` the API fills in the tag by its version, e.g. changes it to `mlrun/mlrun:0.9.2`. And if the API gets upgraded you'll automatically get a new API image. 
- Append the registry prefix, saving the image in the datanode registry, except for any third party k8s installations. This pulls the image more quickly, and also supports air-gapped sites. When you specify an MLRun image, for example `mlrun/mlrun:0.9.1`, the actual image used is similar to `datanode-registry.iguazio-platform.app.vm`.

These characteristics are great when youâ€™re working in a POC or development environment. But MLRun typically upgrades packages as part of the image, and therefore the default MLRun images can break your product flow. 

### Working with images in production
For production you should create your own images to ensure that the image is fixed.
- Pin the image tag, e.g. `image="mlrun/mlrun:0.10.0"`. This maintains the image tag at 0.10.0 even when the API is upgraded. Otherwise, an upgrade of the API would also upgrade the image. (If you specify `mlrun/mlrun` the result is the docker/k8s default behavior, which defaults to `latest` when the tag is not provided.)
- Specify the exact packages your system uses (e.g. specific tensorflow or pytorch package).
- Pin the versions of requirements, again to avoid breakages, e.g. `pandas==1.4.0`. (If you only specify the package name, e.g. pandas, then pip/conda (python's package managers) just pick up the latest version.)
